TODO
- Ability to test with multiple users. (maybe different clients?)
- End/death screen
- update font (to make it as similar as possible to Agar.io,  a simple, rounded sans-serif, closely resembling fonts like Friends or similar geometric/friendly sans-serif styles)

Later: 
- different game modes
- Coin system 
- Skins/images for your player/blob
- settings
- add pages such as Privacy settings, cookie policy, privacy policy, terms of service, contact and support (with actual information and data)
- Leaderboard
- Shop
- Daily quests
- levels
- boosts (such as mass boost or xp boost)
- Clone death screen as accurate as possible.
